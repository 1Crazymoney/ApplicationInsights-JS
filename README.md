* Clone the Git repository

## Performance testing results

For this release, we added a perfResults.txt.csv file that documents the history of performance measurements of the code in the master branch to share with the community the performance of the JavaScript SDK.

When running the performance tests locally, a similar file will be produced that could be used to measure the impact your new code would have on the project.
